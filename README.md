# SG Bicycle Parking

**Now you no longer need to struggle to find public bike spaces in Singapore!**

This project overcomes the lack of publically available information on parking spaces in Singapore. It provides [code](SG_Bicycle_Parking.ipynb) to query the bicycle parking spaces and turn them into a format that can be mapped. The final map can be accessed via [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1-227QXt0TYreScdFNKz8Tu2wz4VUlwg&usp=sharing).

A note on different types of parking spaces
- _Yellow Boxes_ are parking spots with a QR code that can usually be used in bike sharing apps.
- _Racks_ are different types of bike parking that are often available at HDBs or MRT stations.

The code is also available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11F4NoYkEJ1Iui15EGkUwj1vLdm04w1SJ?usp=sharing). 

The data is quered from the [BicycleParkingv2 API](http://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/BicycleParkingv2) provided by [LTA's DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html). You can easily apply for API key there.
